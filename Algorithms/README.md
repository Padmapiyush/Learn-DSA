## Algorithms
### Sorting Algorithms
1. **Bubble Sort**: repeatedly swap adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, until the entire array is sorted.
2. **Selection Sort**: repeatedly select the smallest element and move it to the front of the array, until the entire array is sorted.
3. **Insertion Sort**: repeatedly insert the next element in the correct position in the sorted portion of the array, until the entire array is sorted.
4. **Merge Sort**: recursively divide the array in half, sort each half, and merge the two sorted halves back together.
5. **Quick Sort**: select a pivot element, partition the array into elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot, and recursively sort the two partitions.
### Searching Algorithms
1. **Linear Search**: iterate through each element in the array and return the index of the element if it is found.
2. **Binary Search**: divide the array in half, check if the middle element is the target, and recursively search the left or right half depending on whether the target is less than or greater than the middle element. Binary search only works on sorted arrays.
That's just a brief overview of some common data structures and algorithms. There's a lot more to explore in the world of DSA!
