# Algorithms

## 1. Sorting:
Algorithms to sort elements in ascending or descending order. Examples include 
- [bubble sort](https://github.com/Padmapiyush/Learn-DSA/tree/main/Algorithms/1.%20Sorting#1-bubble-sort), 
- [insertion sort](https://github.com/Padmapiyush/Learn-DSA/tree/main/Algorithms/1.%20Sorting#2-insertion-sort), 
- [selection sort](https://github.com/Padmapiyush/Learn-DSA/tree/main/Algorithms/1.%20Sorting#3-selection-sort), 
- [quick sort](https://github.com/Padmapiyush/Learn-DSA/tree/main/Algorithms/1.%20Sorting#4-quick-sort), 
- [merge sort](https://github.com/Padmapiyush/Learn-DSA/tree/main/Algorithms/1.%20Sorting#5-merge-sort), and 
- [heap sort](https://github.com/Padmapiyush/Learn-DSA/tree/main/Algorithms/1.%20Sorting#6-heap-sort).

## 2. Searching:
Algorithms to find the location of an element in a data structure. Examples include 
- linear search and 
- binary search.

## 3. Recursion:
A programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. Examples include 
- Fibonacci series, 
- factorial, and 
- Tower of Hanoi.

## 4. Dynamic Programming:
A technique to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems and reusing solutions to those sub-problems. Examples include 
- Knapsack problem and 
- Longest Common Subsequence problem.

## 5. Graph Algorithms: 
Algorithms to solve problems related to graphs. Examples include 
- breadth-first search, 
- depth-first search, 
- Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, and 
- Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm.
