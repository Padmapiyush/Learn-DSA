## 1. Fibonacci
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and the subsequent numbers are generated by adding the previous two numbers. The Fibonacci sequence can be represented using the following recursive formula:

> F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

Here's an example of a recursive function that calculates the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        return n; // base case: return n if n is 0 or 1
    }
    else {
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2); // recursive case: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
    }
}

int main() {
    int n = 7;
    int result = fibonacci(n);
    cout << "The " << n << "th number in the Fibonacci sequence is " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In the above code, the `fibonacci` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. The base case is when `n` is 0 or 1, in which case the function returns `n`. The recursive case is when `n` is greater than `1`, in which case the function calls itself with `n-1` and `n-2` as the arguments and adds the results.

In the main function, we call the `fibonacci` function with `n=7` and print the result.

The above code uses recursion to calculate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence. However, this approach can be slow for large values of `n`, since it requires recalculating the same subproblems multiple times. A more efficient approach is to use dynamic programming to store the previously calculated values and avoid redundant calculations.
