# Linked Lists in C++
### What is a linked list?
A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains an element and a pointer to the next node.

### Creating a linked list
In C++, you can create a linked list by defining a Node class that contains an element and a pointer to the next node.

```c++
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;
};
```

### Inserting elements into a linked list
You can insert elements into a linked list by creating a new Node and updating the pointers of the adjacent nodes.

```c++
void insert(Node*& head, int data) {
    Node* new_node = new Node();
    new_node->data = data;
    new_node->next = head;
    head = new_node;
}
```
### Traversing a linked list
You can traverse a linked list by starting at the head node and following the next pointers until you reach the end of the list.

```c++
void traverse(Node* head) {
    Node* current = head;
    while (current != nullptr) {
        cout << current->data << " ";
        current = current->next;
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

### Deleting elements from a linked list
You can delete an element from a linked list by updating the pointers of the adjacent nodes and freeing the memory used by the deleted node.

```c++
void delete_node(Node*& head, int data) {
    Node* current = head;
    Node* prev = nullptr;
    while (current != nullptr && current->data != data) {
        prev = current;
        current = current->next;
    }
    if (current == nullptr) {
        return;
    }
    if (prev == nullptr) {
        head = current->next;
    } else {
        prev->next = current->next;
    }
    delete current;
}
```
### Conclusion
Linked lists are a dynamic data structure in C++ that can be used to store and manipulate a collection of elements. By understanding how to create, insert, traverse, and delete nodes in a linked list, you can use linked lists effectively in your programs.
