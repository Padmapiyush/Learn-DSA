## Data Structures
### Arrays
1. An array is a collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations.
2. The elements of an array can be accessed using an index, which starts at 0 and goes up to the length of the array minus one.
3. Arrays have constant-time access to any element, but inserting or deleting an element in the middle of the array takes linear time.
### Linked Lists
1. A linked list is a collection of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list.
2. Linked lists can be singly linked (where each node only has a reference to the next node) or doubly linked (where each node has references to both the next and previous nodes).
3. Inserting or deleting an element in a linked list takes constant time, but accessing an element in the middle of the list takes linear time.
### Stacks
A stack is a collection of elements that supports two main operations: push (adding an element to the top of the stack) and pop (removing the top element from the stack).
Stacks have a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order, meaning that the most recently added element is the first one to be removed.
Stacks can be implemented using an array or a linked list.
### Queues
A queue is a collection of elements that supports two main operations: enqueue (adding an element to the back of the queue) and dequeue (removing the front element from the queue).
Queues have a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order, meaning that the first element added is the first one to be removed.
Queues can be implemented using an array or a linked list.
